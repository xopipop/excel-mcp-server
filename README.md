## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue: ImportError with MCP

If you encounter:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'stdio_transport' from 'mcp.server'
```

This has been fixed in the code. The import in `main.py` has been updated from:
```python
from mcp.server import Server, stdio_transport
```
to:
```python
from mcp.server import Server
from mcp.server.stdio import stdio_transport
```

### Using pip
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

### Using virtual environment (recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üîß Configuration

The server uses YAML configuration files located in the `config/` directory:

- `default.yaml`: Main configuration
- `security.yaml`: Security policies and rules

### Basic Configuration
```yaml
server:
  name: "pc-control-mcp"
  version: "2.0.0"
  log_level: "INFO"
  
security:
  enabled: true
  authentication:
    type: "none"  # none, basic, token
```

### Security Configuration
Configure allowed/blocked operations:
```yaml
file_operations:
  blocked_paths:
    - "/etc"
    - "C:\\Windows\\System32"
  blocked_extensions: [".exe", ".dll", ".sys"]
  
process_management:
  blocked_processes: ["systemd", "init", "kernel"]
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Start the Server
```bash
python main.py
```

### Connect with MCP Client
The server uses stdio transport. Configure your MCP client to connect:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pc-control": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/main.py"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

- User/session info
- Operation result
- Error details (if any)

### Best Practices
1. Run with minimal required privileges
2. Configure strict access controls
3. Enable audit logging
4. Use authentication in production
5. Regularly review audit logs
